                <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                     <p>My name is Tayllor Lawson, I was born on July 27th in the year 
                     2000. I was born at Clovis Community Regional Medical Center in
                     Clovis, California. In my family, I have three siblings; my sister
                     Madison, she is 18 years old, my sister Zoe, she is 20 years old, 
                     and my brother Timothy, he is 24 years old. My mother is 40 and 
                     her name is Shylene and my Father is 46 and his name is Ryan. 
                     My parents are divorced.</p>
                     <p>My hobbies include soccer, football, baseball, computers, 
                     video games, and hanging out with friends. My dream vacation would 
                     be on a Disney Cruise or a two week trip to Walt Disney World.
                     Someday I would like to visit every Disney park!</p>

                 <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                       <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                       <p>One of my long term goals is to become a Cast Member at
                      Disneyland in Anaheim. I love the happiness that goes on in
                      the park. I really enjoy seeing the smiles kids and adults 
                      have when they’re at the park. I want to be a part of what 
                      makes those smiles!</p>
                       <p>Another long term goal I have is to become an animator 
                       for Disney/Pixar Studios. I like art and movies and I am 
                       really into video production so I want to learn to become an 
                       animator. Disney is renowned for having the best animated 
                       movies and I would love to see my name on the credits of an
                       amazing animated Disney movie!</p>
                        <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                      <p>One of my short term goals is to graduate high school and
                      enter college at CSUF in Anaheim, California. I want to go 
                      there because they have animation classes and it’s a five 
                      minute drive from Disneyland. I can study animation and work 
                      at Disneyland!</p>
                      <p>Another one of my short term goals is to visit my dad in 
                      Napa, California, but bring a friend. Napa is the most 
                      beautiful place an d it’s greatit  for riding bikes and
                      exploring around the river! Its also very close to the bay, 
                      so I would like to take a ferry from Vallejo to San Francisco
                      with my friend too! I take this ferry trip every time I visit
                      my dad.</p>

                       <h3>Educational</h3>
                            <p>An educational goal I have accomplished is passing Algebra.
                              In the 2014-2015 school year I attended Fresno High School.
                              My Algebra teacher was fired at the beginning of the year so 
                              for the rest of the year we never had a real teacher, we had 
                              substitutes every day for the rest of the year. The
                              substitutes would never actually teach so I fell far 
                              behind but I made a goal to pass with at least a C. After 
                              studying hard and long and working extra, I finished the year
                              with the highest grade in the class.</p>
                       <h3>Personal</h3>
                          <p>A personal goal I have accomplished is paying to take my 
                          mom to Disneyland. My mom loves Disneyland and so in the 
                          summer of 2014 I worked all summer in my neighborhood washing 
                          cars and doing yard work and I earned over $850 and I used 
                          the money to pay for a two day trip to Disneyland!</p>
